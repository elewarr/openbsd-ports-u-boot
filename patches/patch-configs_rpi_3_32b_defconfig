rpi: Use firmware provided device tree

Currently the firmware generates a device tree for us that we could
just use to adjust ourselves. We then on boot throw that away and
use our own built-in device tree to configure device access.

This is bad for a multitude of reasons. For starters, it breaks
overlay support in config.txt, confusing users. Much worse however
is that we are stuck with individual U-Boot builds per board.
The firmware can easily give us the right DT depending on the
target board and revision though.

So let's use the firmware provided device tree instead. That way
U-Boot as well as payloads loaded by it can automatically adapt
to variants of RPi hardware.
